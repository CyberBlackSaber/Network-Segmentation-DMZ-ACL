# Network-Segmentation using DMZ and ACLs
## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a segmented network using a DMZ and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized traffic.

## Objective
To reduce attack surface and control traffic flow between internal, DMZ, and external networks.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Routers and switches (firewall simulation)
- Servers and end-user devices

## What I Did
- Designed a network with internal, DMZ, and external zones
- Implemented ACLs to restrict traffic between zones
- Tested connectivity to validate security controls

## Security Relevance
- Demonstrates network hardening and access control
- Relevant to SOC monitoring and network defense
